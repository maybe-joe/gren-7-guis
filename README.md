# Gren - 7 GUIs

> [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis) is a set of small tasks, suitable for demonstrating how common GUI patterns can be implemented in a specific framework.
> The following folders implement the solutions to the [7GUIs tasks](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks)

This repo contains implementations of the 7GUIs tasks in the Gren language. I created it after seeing the official [Gren examples projects](https://github.com/gren-lang/example-projects) repo as a way to learn the language.
